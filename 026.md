Hey all!

I apologise for the delay. I had a report submission due 11:59 PM IST on June 10, and we mailed it to the prof at 12:01 AM IST on June 11. :(

So back to our application. Suppose the network is set up, and running. Now some new node wants to join this network. How is it supposed to join? For this purpose, we need to make endpoints so that a node that joins the network late can get the blockchain that was formed before it joined.

First, we need an endpoint `/getBlock/<n>`. A GET request to this endpoint will return the binary data for the `n`th block. The `Content-Type` header for the HTTP response will be `application/octet-stream`.
Then we need another endpoint `/getPendingTransactions`. A GET request to this endpoint will return the pending transactions as JSON. The `Content-Type` header for the HTTP response will be `application/json`. The format of the data should be:
```
{
    [
        {
            "inputs": [
                {
                    "transactionID": "<hex representation of the transaction ID of this input>",
                    "index": <index of this input in the list of outputs of the transaction>,
                    "signature": "<hex representation of the signature for this input>"
                },
                {
                    "transactionID": "<hex representation of the transaction ID of this input>",
                    "index": <index of this input in the list of outputs of the transaction>,
                    "signature": "<hex representation of the signature for this input>"
                }
            ],
            "outputs": [
                {
                    "amount": <number of coins>,
                    "recipient": "<public key of recipient>"
                },
                {
                    "amount": <number of coins>,
                    "recipient": "<public key of recipient>"
                },
                {
                    "amount": <number of coins>,
                    "recipient": "<public key of recipient>"
                }
            ]
        },
        {
            "inputs": [
                {
                    "transactionID": "<hex representation of the transaction ID of this input>",
                    "index": <index of this input in the list of outputs of the transaction>,
                    "signature": "<hex representation of the signature for this input>"
                },
                ...
            ],
            "outputs": [
                {
                    "amount": <number of coins>,
                    "recipient": "<public key of recipient>"
                },
                ...
            ]
        },
        ...
    ]
}
```

Create these two endpoints.
