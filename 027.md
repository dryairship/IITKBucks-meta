Hey all!

Next you have to implement four more endpoints:

 - `/newPeer` : a peer will send you a POST request on this endpoint to register itself as your peer. The request will contain JSON data with the URL of the peer. You need to add the URL to your list of peers. The URL will be simply the protocol(https/http), the hostname (and maybe a port), without any endpoint or trailing slash. Examples: "https://dryblockchain.com", "http://a38dc2.ngrok.io", "https://blockchain.pclub.in:8787", "http://202.23.145.3:5000". The request data will be of the following format:
```
{
    "url": "https://meow.lol"
}
```

 - `/getPeers` : when you receive a GET request on this endpoint, you should return the list of all your peers in JSON format. The response format should be:
```
{
    "peers": ["https://dryblockchain.com", "http://a38dc2.ngrok.io", "https://blockchain.pclub.in:8787", "http://202.23.145.3:5000"]
}
```

 - `/newBlock` : a peer will send you a POST request to this endpoint with the complete block data (in binary format) when a new block is mined. You should add this block to your blockchain.

 - `/newTransaction` : a peer/user will send you a POST request to this endpoint when a new transaction is made. This endpoint should accept JSON data and add it to the list of pending transactions. The data will be in the following format:
```
{
    "inputs": [
        {
            "transactionID": "<hex representation of the transaction ID of this input>",
            "index": <index of this input in the list of outputs of the transaction>,
            "signature": "<hex representation of the signature for this input>"
        },
        ...
    ],
    "outputs": [
        {
            "amount": <number of coins>,
            "recipient": "<public key of recipient>"
        },
        ...
    ]
}
```

You don't have to write code for verification right now. Once you implement these endpoints, you'd just have to add a function call later to verify a transaction or a block.
