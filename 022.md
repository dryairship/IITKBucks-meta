Suppose in a transaction, the sum of coins in your inputs is 100. You create 2 outputs in the transaction. One of 50 coins and another of 30 coins. You don't use the remaining 20 coins. Then the miner who mines the block will get these 20 coins as the transaction fee.

So when a miner tries to mine a block, it also adds one more transaction to the group of transactions before starting the process of finding the nonce. The miner sums up the transaction fees of all the transactions to get the total transaction fee. He then adds to it a fixed amount known as the "block reward" (which the miner gets as a reward for mining the block). He then create a transaction which has no inputs, and one output. This output has the miner's public key in the recipient field and the sum of block reward and the total transaction fee in the field for the number of coins. This transaction should be the first transaction in the block.

This is why someone would want to start mining - to get richer. Also, block rewards are the only way of introducing new coins into the system (i.e., to increase the total money in the system).

In Ethereum, the block reward is a constant. In Bitcoin, the block reward decreases by a fixed factor after a fixed period of time (the block reward becomes half after every 210000 blocks, which is around 4 years) (Interestingly, this happened a few days ago: https://ia.acs.org.au/article/2020/the-value-of-bitcoin-blocks-just-halved.html). Since block rewards are the only method of adding money to the system, the halving of block rewards creates a geometric progression with ratio 0.5, which is less than one. This implies that the sum of this series is a finite value, and hence, there is a fixed limit to the number of bitcoins that will ever exist. If you google "what will happen when all bitcoins are mined", you'll get interesting articles. For the lazy ones, here is one such article: https://news.bitcoin.com/what-happens-bitcoin-miners-all-coins-mined/ I personally believe the the bitcoin bubble is going to crash, some day. Not because blockchains or cryptocurrencies are bad, but because the Bitcoin was way ahead of its time (read: some design principles were short-sighted), and the modern alternatives are much better since they have learn from the mistakes of Bitcoin.


## Questions

### If I am a user, then I should leave some coins unused (for transaction fee) in my transaction to incentivize the transaction to be included in some block by a miner. However, the number of coins I need to leave unused (for transaction fee) is not fixed, but depends on the user. As a user, if I leave more number of coins unused (i.e. offer higher transaction fee), then my transaction is expected to be verified faster. Is this right?

Yes that is correct.

### What are block rewards?

Block rewards are the coins that a miner gets when they mine a new block. This is a mechanism to encourage people to mine more blocks (otherwise, why would you spend your computing power to confirm transactions for someone else?)

### Can number of coins only be an integer? Can it not be a fraction?If it can be a fraction, then block reward would never become zero. And logically the value of Bitcoin is going to increase as we reach closer to the finite sum of GP. Hence, essentially, the block reward would still remain significant in terms of value and miners would always be incentivised. Right? If it cannot be a fraction, then this might be serious shortcoming for the user. Because he is tied up to spend in minimum denomination of 1 coin, which means he cannot use Bitcoin for transferring a value less than a coin?  (This is a serious problem because the value of a single Bitcoin is pretty big right now and so it is like saying you are only allowed to spend in denominations of a crore rupees)

Yes the number of coins will always be an integer. We can't use floating point numbers because of their limitations of precision. For example, open up a python shell on your terminal by executing `python`, then:
 - Type `47823894712939318.0-47823894712939311.0`. You can see that the answer is supposed to be `7.0`, but it'll say `8.0`.
 - Type `0.2+0.1` and you won't get `0.3` :) 

Yes the user cannot spend less than 1 coin, but then we can make it such that 1 coin is not worth much. For example, we can make the currency valued such that users always have to spend coins in millions to buy anything. In fact, we can make a different type of denomination - like a note, and then stipulate that 1 note = 1 million coins. Then users buy things using notes (and they think that they can spend fractional notes), but in reality they are just spending a large number of coins. In fact, this is how other cryptocurrencies implement it. For example, you cannot spend less than 1 satoshi in the Bitcoin system, and 1 bitcoin is defined at 10^9 satoshis. In Ethereum, you cannot spend less than 1 wei, and 1 ether is defined at 10^18 wei.

### Does more transaction fees imply faster mining?

More transaction fees does not directly imply faster mining. It implies that all the miners would try to include your transaction in the next block they try to mine, so that they may collect this transaction fees, and hence it means your transaction has a higher probability of being confirmed within the next few blocks.
