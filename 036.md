Hey @channel!

I hope your programs are ready, or almost ready. My server at iitkbucks.ac.in is (hopefully) running properly. You can verify the blocks there, and make your own transactions. if you face any problems, let me know. Also, I am implementing logging in my application (should be done in about 1-2 hrs). So if there is some error, I will print it in my logs, and the HTTP response will contain the error message as a string. You are also advised to put simple log statements in your program (like, new block mined with index i, block i received from peer x, new peer x added, etc). This would help debugging your applications.

Now we need to do a demo run. For that, we need to be connected to the same network in order to communicate with each other. The internet is the obvious candidate. However, there are millions of computers on the internet, so it becomes difficult to uniquely identify any computer using an IP address. For this purpose, a combination of host name (like iitkbucks.pclub.in) and IP address is used to identify computers. 

For example, if you run the command `ping iitkbucks.pclub.in` it will show you the IP address of the server. You can observe that the IP addresses are the same for search.pclub.in, iitkbucks.pclub.in, techkriti.org etc. However, the hostname helps in identifying which request goes where.

So thousands of other people have the same IP address on the internet as your public IP (which itself is not static). To uniquely identify your computer, you will need a static (i.e. fixed) IP address and a host name. However, we do not want to buy a hostname, neither do we have a static IP address.

To overcome this, we can deploy our applications on some other computer, which has a static IP address and can provide you with a host name. These are services like Azure, Heroku, Amazon AWS etc. However, they require a fee, and others that are free (like Heroku) have some limitations. For Heroku, if your app does not receive any request for 5 minutes it goes into sleep mode. Further, I am not sure if heroku will give you enough processing power for mining.

So we need to deploy it on our own computers. To get a hostname then, we can use a tunneling software (like PageKite, ngrok etc) that has a static IP and can provide us with a host name. Again, the problem is that free version of ngrok has certain limitations, which we faced during the demo of assignment 6 (Too many requests error etc.).

We could have solved the problem by not deploying our programs over internet, but on some other smaller network, where we all have different IP addresses and so hostname resolution is not required. One candidate for such a network is IITK's internal network. However, we are not in IITK right now and hence we can't do that. I tried to see if we can connect to each other while on IITK proxy, but that is also not possible. 

So it seems like we will have to stick to ngrok. It has a limit of 40 connections per minute. We can just hope that is sufficient :p 

We will have a demo tomorrow (July 17) at 12:00 PM. If you are unavailable at that time, react to this message with a :banana:.
