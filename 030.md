The next task is to verify a block. You have already implemented the code to verify a single transaction. You just need to do a few more things to verify an entire block. You need to check that:
  - Every transaction in the block is valid (Remember the exception of the coinbase transaction - the first transaction in every block)
  - The hash of the parent block is correct.
  - The header of the block has been correctly calculated.
  - The specified nonce creates a hash which is less than the target.

Once you write the function for verifying a block, you can just put it everywhere you need to verify a block, i.e., whenever you receive a new block.

We need to increase our pace, so the deadline for this task is 11:59 PM IST on Tuesday, 30th June 2020.

Also remember that the block at index 0 is verified differently. Its parent hash is a special case.


## Questions

### How do we verify the coinbase transaction ?  
You must first verify all other transactions, and then calculate the total amount of transaction fees to it. Then add a fixed amount of block reward to it (just use a variable for now, we'll decide the value later). The only output of the coinbase transaction must be less than or equal to this sum.
