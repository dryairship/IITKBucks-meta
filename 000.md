Hey all!

Here is a short task to test if you're good with the pre-requisites of this project.

You have to create a simple web server in any language of your choice, using any framework you want to use. The server should listen on port 8787.

There should be one endpoint `/hash` which accepts a POST request that contains JSON encoded data in the following format:

```
{
    "data": "<a string>"
}
```

and the endpoint should calculate the SHA-256 hash of the given string, convert it to hexadecimal representation, and return it in the following format as JSON encoded data:

```
{
    "hash": "hexadecimal representation of the SHA-256 hash of the given string"
}
```

You should push the code to GitHub and submit the repository link here: https://forms.gle/M9gaEJWrgc1YwCkf7. The deadline for submission in 6:00 PM IST, April 23, 2020. So you have approx 30 hours as of sending this mail. The repository should be made public after the deadline is over.

If you have any doubts, contact us on Messenger / Email / anywhere else.

Happy coding!
