I'll assume that all of you are familiar with what hashes are and how to create hashes. I will also assume that you know how to create a web server, and handle requests.

Note that a cryptographic function acts on bytes (which may represent a string, a number, an image, or anything else), to produce bytes (which you may interpret as a string, a number, an image, or anything else). In the selection task, I just wanted you to represent the output bytes as a hexadecimal number. However, some of you had made the program return the hexadecimal representation of the ASCII text of the hexadecimal representation of the output bytes. If you're on of those, make sure you understand that the inputs and outputs of an encryption function are bytes and not strings.

Also, I had only asked you to create one endpoint that accepted a JSON encoded string and returned the hash in JSON format. Some of you still made an index.html file WITH A FORM(?). Note that a form always sends the data in x-www-form-urlencoded content type, and never in JSON type. If you're one of those, make sure you understand the difference between the two. You can read this answer here for more clarity: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/9870523/differences-in-application-json-and-application-x-www-form-urlencoded

We'll start the project tomorrow. I expect that you'll have clarity on these issues by then. If you have any questions, feel free to ask.
