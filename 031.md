Hey all!

Now comes the most difficult part of our application. We need to perform two operations simultaneously - mining, and handling requests. The mining part is easy. But doing these things simultaneously is very tough for someone who has never done something like this before. Essentially we'd need the following structure:

 - A running server that handles requests (All of you have this part ready)
 - A miner the keeps trying to mine new blocks (Assignment 5)
 - A two-way communication channel between them:
   - When the server receives a new block and it has verified it to be correct, the miner should be notified to stop mining the old block, and start mining a new one.
   - When the miner has mined a block, the server should be notified to send out this block to its peers.

This two way communication channel can be truncated to a one-way communication channel, if we introduce a new element in the structure: the part that handles all the steps whenever a new block a mined (this includes the action of informing the peers). The server and the miner should both be able to execute the post-new-block steps. THis can be easily accomplished by a single function call. However, we need a one way communication channel: the server should be able to tell the miner to stop mining the old block and start mining the new one.

There are numerous ways this could be achieved - using asynchronous functions and workers. I'm sorry, I missed out this important part during the assignments phase. And I want you to first try to do this before we start with mining. 

Treat this as your assignment 7. The code should be pushed to the assignment repo.

You have to create a server with two endpoints:
 
 - `/start`: This endpoint will receive a string and will start the worker to mine it (exactly the same way as the first assignment). The target will be `0000000f00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000`. THis endpoint should just return status 200 immediately. You may assume that this will only be called once. This will accept a POST request with the following JSON data:
```
{
    "data" : "meowmeow"
}
```
 
 - `/result': Whenever a get request is made to this endpoint, it should immediately send back a JSON response in the following format:
```
{
    "result": "found", // Either "found" or "searching"
    "nonce": 123 // This field should be -1 if still searching, or the nonce value if it has been found.
}
```
 
The important part here is the worker. It should run separate from the main thread (or the main thread will be blocked and you'll not be able to receive any requests). For nodejs, there's a very easy to use package called `worker_threads` (https://nodesource.com/blog/worker-threads-nodejs/). For python, you should look at the module `threading` (https://eli.thegreenplace.net/2011/12/27/python-threads-communication-and-stopping). For Java, `java.util.concurrent` package has all the required tools (https://www.vogella.com/tutorials/JavaConcurrency/article.html).

The deadline for this assignment is 11:59 AM IST on July 3, 2020.
