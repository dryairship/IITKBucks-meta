The project is almost ready. Just write out a final function for the post new block steps. The steps are:

 - Process the new block (I believe you have already implemented this part previously, just call the same function)
 - Send out the new block to your peers.

These steps are to be executed when you receive a valid block, and when you yourself mine a new block.

When this is done, react here appropriately: https://github.com/dryairship/IITKBucks/issues/8

This is a very simple task, so there is no deadline. You should be able to complete it quickly.
