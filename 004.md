Note: Whatever we are going to discuss below, is a very simplified model. This leaves out a few essential things, which we would cover later.

A blockchain is essentially like a linked list.

In a linked list, each item contains the address of the next item. In a blockchain, each block contains the hash of the previous block (i.e. the parent block).

Similar to a linked list, each block can have only one parent block, and each parent can have only one child. You can store any type of data in a block (for a cryptocurrency, the data stored contains the transactions).

The structure of a block is like the following:

```
Block {
    index      // The index of the block in the blockchain. This is equal to 1 + the index of the parent block.
    timestamp  // The time at which the block was mined
    data       // The data contained inside the block (can be of any data type)
    parentHash // The hash of the parent block
    nonce      // The nonce value such that the hash of this entire block is less than the target
}
```

Also, blockchains are distributed. It means that every node has a copy of the blockchain.

If one node mines a new block, it shares it to every other node on the network so that they can include it in their chain.

Whenever a node receives a new block, it should verify if the block is valid. There are a few things to verify:

 - Every transaction in the block is valid.
 - The hash of the parent block is correct.
 - The specified nonce creates a hash which is less than the target.
 
It should be very easy to implement the verification of the nonce and the hash of the parent block. To verify transactions, however, you need to do some work.

A transaction looks like the following:

```
Transaction {
    id      // A unique ID for every transaction
    input   // There can only be one input
    outputs // There can be multiple outputs. This is an array of outputs.
}
```

The `input` contains a reference to some previous output. Think of it this way: if you have some money, you definitely received it from somewhere. So to prove that you have the money you say, you need to tell me that output in the existing blockchain that gave you the money. So the input contains the ID of that output which gave you the money.

The `output` is what you do with the money that you have. Like, if some transaction gave me 100 coins, and I want to spend them, here's how I would do it: I have 100 coins, I give 20 coins to A, 30 coins to B, and keep the rest of the 50 coins with myself. Thus, this input has 3 outputs. 20->A, 30->B, 50->myself.

Each output contains three things: 

```
Output {
    id        // A unique ID for every output 
    amount    // The mount of money used in this output
    recipient // The account that receives this money
}
```

Note that one input can only be used once. This is why if you want to spend money only partly, you need to have one output that sends the money back to you.

Whenever a block is mined, it contains the new transactions that have occurred. So you take all the outputs of all the transactions and store it somewhere. Now whenever you encounter a new transaction, you first check if the input for this transaction exists in your list of unused outputs. If it does, this is a valid transaction. You should now remove this particular output from your list of unused outputs. Thus, one output can only be used once.
Also, you need to check if the total money being spent in this transaction is less than or equal to the money that is in the input.

So now you can verify all the things that you should verify whenever you receive a new block.

There is no assignment for now. Instead, you should start building the client. For now, create the following classes: Blockchain, Block, Transaction, Output (and any other that you think you'll need). Also make a function to add a new block to the blockchain, and verify if it's correct.

All the IDs (transaction ID, output ID etc) should be UUID-V4.

Note that some transactions can have no inputs (like, when new coins are generated. More on this later.) For now, check if the input ID is `1`. If it is, then this transaction has no input.

To evaluate the hash of a block, for now, just convert the block object to a JSON string (there are libraries to do this) and then calculate the hash of that string. This method is going to undergo improvements later.

I know there will be a lot of confusion regarding this. Please feel free to discuss any question you have.

## Questions

### Is the parent Hash used twice in the hash calculation, because it's already stored in the pointer to the previous block and it seems we are storing it again in the block?

ParentHash is the hash of the parent block. And yes, while calculating the hash of the current block, you need to include it in the hash calculation too.

### Suppose the 100 coins that I possess came from several transactions. If i want to send all the 100 coins to someone, will I break this transaction into smaller transactions to account for the 100 coins that exist in pieces since each transaction takes only one input?

As of now, yes you need to break it down into multiple transactions. Maybe later we can improve the model so that a transaction may take multiple inputs. 

### How are we supposed to refer to the recipient?

For now, the `recipient` field can be a string denoting the username of the person receiving the amount.

### What will be the input string for finding the nonce of a block?

Arey see. You have all the fields in the block object fixed. Only the nonce has to be found. So you guess a nonce, set the nonce of the object to this value. Convert the object to a JSON string, take the SHA256 hash. Check if it is below the target. If it is not, change the nonce value in the object itself. Again convert it to a JSON string. Repeat.

### How can we make a hash value point to a block? I mean we need something like a pointer which has a data location in it right?

No no. You just need to store the hash of the parent block in parentHash. There is no need to point to the parent block itself. You'll already know the parent block by the index value.
