So now you have your assignment 5. You are given the index of the block, the hash of the parent block, the target value, and a binary file which contains the block body. You task is to write a program to calculate the block header of this block and find a suitable nonce value. Your program should ask for input for the index, the parent hash, the target, and the file containing the body of the block. It should then print the found nonce value, the timestamp, and the calculated hash of the block header (which should obviously be below the target.) Your README file for this assignment should contain the timestamp and the nonce value that you have calculated for the sample data. 

Sample data:

```
Index: 5
Hash of parent block: 2b21ef8ab698e7daf03ccf0110acb4d844fabb5b9513221285f96593d4d4a573
Target: 0000000f00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
Block body: 016.dat (Attached)
```

With the given target, you might have to wait for some time for your program to find a valid nonce value. I ran my program 3 times, and the time range was very wide. First time it took 3m3s, second time it took 11.8s, third time it took 7m56s. I recommend you to calculate the time it takes for your program to find a nonce value. Calculate the timestamp before you start searching, and then again after you finish, Subtract and print. This is not required, but it would be a fun thing to try to measure this a few times. If you do this, please mention the times in your README file.

I believe this assignment is an easy one. The deadline for this assignment is 11:59 PM IST, May 24, 2020.

Note for people using NodeJS: Javascript's numbers do not have 64-but precision by default. You should use BigInt. For normal numbers, you need to append `n` to it to make it a BigInt. Probably because of the same reason, javascript doesn't have an in built direct Unix nanoseconds calculator. You can use https://www.npmjs.com/package/nano-time - this returns the timestamp as a string. You can look here to convert it to BigInt: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/36826748/how-to-convert-strings-to-bigint-in-javascript
