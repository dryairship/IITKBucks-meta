I hope I can safely assume the following things now:

 - You can represent any type of data (string,integer,...) as a sequence of bytes, and you can represent this sequence of bytes in the hexadecimal format.
 - You can calculate the SHA256 hash of a sequence of bytes.
 - You can create an RSA key pair of a given key size in bits (some of you used 4096 and some used 2048).
 - You can represent an RSA public/private key in PEM format.

Now let's go back to our model of a transaction. We'll make a few changes:

 - A transaction is allowed to have multiple inputs.
 - The ID of a transaction is the SHA256 hash of its data (more on this later)
 - The outputs don't have their own IDs, they have their own indices (like elements in an array). They are referred to by using the transaction ID and the index of the output.

Now, we'll refer to a user (a recipient or a sender) using their public key. The data stored in an output is then: the index of the output, the amount of coins in this output, and the recipient's public key. If we get an array of outputs, we already know the index of each output by it's position in this array. So we don't need to explicitly store the index in each output. For the public key, we can serialize it in the PEM format. The amount of coins can be stored as a 64-bit integer (which is 8 bytes), but the length of the public key _might_ vary. So you need to store the length of the public key too (the reason will make sense in some time). We will assume that the length of a public key can fit in a 32-bit integer.

So here is how we represent an output, by first representing everything as bytes, and then concatenating it all together:  
`[the number of coins][length of the public key][the public key]`

So when you see a blob (a series of bytes), which represents an output, here is what you do:  

 - You read the first 8 bytes. This represents a 64-bit integer. This is the number of coins.
 - Then you read the next 4 bytes. This represents a 32-bit integer. This is the length of the public key. Let this value be `x`. 
 - Finally, you read the next `x` bytes. This is the public key in PEM format.
 
And when you have multiple outputs, you can just concatenate it all together. Like this:  
`[number of coins in output 1][length of the public key for output 1][the public key for output 1][number of coins in output 2][length of the public key for output 2][the public key for output 2]...`

I hope now you realize why we need to store the length of the public key.

This entire sequence of bytes represents our total output data. But wait, we also need one more thing. How long will we keep reading the outputs? We need to know the number of outputs as well. This can be represented as a 32-bit integer.

Now let us come to the inputs. Recall that each input actually refers to a previous output. So, each input contains the following data: The transaction ID (in which the output is contained), the index of the output in the list of outputs for that transaction, and a signature which verifies that the person who wants to use the output is allowed to use the output.

I said that the ID of a transaction is the SHA256 hash of its data. This means that it is of 256 bits, or 32 bytes. The index of an output is a 32-bit integer, so 4 bytes. For the signature, we again need to store its length first (which is a 32-bit integer) and then the actual signature. So here is how we represent an input: 
`[transaction ID][index of output][length of signature][signature]`

So when you see a blob which represents an input, here is how you read it:  

 - You first read 32 bytes. This represents the transaction ID.
 - You then read the next 4 bytes. This represents a 32-bit integer. This the the index of the output in that transaction.
 - Then you read the next 4 bytes. This represents a 32-bit integer. This is the length of the signature. Let this value be `x`. 
 - Finally, you read the next `x` bytes. This is the signature.

And when you have multiple inputs, you can just concatenate it all together. Like this:  
`[transaction ID for input 1][index of output for input 1][length of signature for input 1][signature for input 1][transaction ID for input 2][index of output for input 2][length of signature for input 2][signature for input 2]...`

This entire sequence of bytes represents our total input data. Again, as in the case of outputs, we need to know the number of inputs as well. This can be represented as a 32-bit integer.

Finally, all the data contained in a transaction can be represented as follows:  
`[number of inputs][TOTAL INPUT DATA][number of outputs][TOTAL OUTPUT DATA]`

Now you have the above sequence of bytes. You calculate the SHA256 hash of this, and you get the transaction ID.

If you have any confusion, please feel free to ask.
