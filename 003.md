Suppose you have a string/an image/anything else. You convert it into binary. You put the bytes together. You now have a long sequence of bits.

Now assume that this sequence of bits represents a number. A very large number. But still a finite positive integer.

Suppose you have a mathematical function f(x): Z->\[1,100\]. This function can take any integer as the input, but always produces the output as an integer between 1 and 100. It is given that this function produces a uniform distribution.

So you give this function an integer as an input. What is the probability that the output will be 5?

1/100 ? 

What is the probability that the output will be less than or equal to 5?

1/20 ?

Let's call 5 our target. Now suppose you want to throw random numbers into the function as input, and you want the output to be less than or equal to our target (which is 5). What is the expected number of times you'll have to try?

20 ?

Now suppose you decrease the target to 4. What is the expected number of times you'll have to try to find an integer x such that f(x)<=target?

25 ?

Thus, now you have to try harder (do more work) to find such a number.

Now suppose you increase the target to 10. What is the expected number of times you'll have to try to find an integer x such that f(x)<=target?

10 ?

Now you have to do less work to find such a number.

This is the essence of mining. You try to find such an input for a function which produces an output that is less than the target. The function used is a hash function, like the SHA-256 hash function. It produces 256 bits as the output (hence the name). If you represent the bytes as an integer, it would lie in the range [0, 2^256). The number is usually written in the hexadecimal format. So the hash value can range from 0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000 to 0xFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFF. But the hash function can take any sequence of bytes as the input.

Also, if you change even a single bit in the input, the generated output is very different from the earlier output. For example:

```
SHA256("dryairship1") = f869c8d9dec84d39ed2afa0001aade4c9045c477a1f8729cec92f32c982d0d6e
SHA256("dryairship2") = 985f4c5e0429a0c53e2230ce65eefd2f77eb48aa94cb47bd9172baa0d9f22ad8
SHA256("dryairship3") = bfb1120349742e156c243fa2909e09313da3c5ba7d815db9810ed7d757168a29
```

Here, we had some constant data ("dryairship"), and a changing value (the number at the end). Mining is the process of finding this changing value that when combined with our data ("dryairship" in our case) will produce an output below the target. Since the range of SHA256 hash function is huge, the target chosen is very high. If we chose the target to be 0x0000FFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFF, the smallest positive integer that satisfies our target is 16962. 

```
SHA256("dryairship16962") = 000032939d7b1788583856044a76a79129b7c52ecb3ef63f384d09b9dd6787b5
```

As soon as we find this magic number 16962, we have achieved success.

If you have any questions regarding anything that has been said above, feel free to ask.


## Assignment
Here is your first assignment: Write a program that takes some data as string input. Then it tries to find a positive number x such that when x is appended to the end of the string, the SHA256 hash of this new string is less than the target, which is 0x0000FFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFF.

Each of you should create a new repository for the assignments. All your assignment submissions will be contained in the same repository. Each assignment should be contained inside a folder "Assignment X" (where X is the assignment number). All your files for that assignment should be inside this folder. Once you have created the repository, share the link here: https://forms.gle/Jz271djAXZTw9NKf6

## Questions

### In which language?
In any language. Prefer mainstream languages like python/java/javascript/c++/go/ruby/..., and not some obscure language.  
You will eventually use similar code in the cryptocurrency client that you build (which will involve handling requests over a web server), so pick a language in which you can do that, and use it throughout the project.  
Ideally, you would like to use the same language that you used for the submission task. Though this is not required.

### For now this target is a hard coded value right?
Yes

### What is the 0x in the target string?
It is just a prefix that is usually used to denote a hexadecimal constant. Like, whenever you see a 0x, you can safely assume that the part following it is a hexadecimal number. Similarly, 0b is used for binay. Like 0b01000100.
