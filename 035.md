Hey !

We now need to make a final part using which the user interacts with the system. There are 4 major things a user would want to do:
 - Check their balance.
 - Generate a pair of keys.
 - Transfer coins to someone else.
 - Add an alias to a public key.

Let's discuss them one by one:

 - **Adding alias**: Just ask the user for an alias, and a public key file. Then make a request to the server. This is the simplest part of this task.
 - **Generating keys**: You need to generate RSA keys of size 2048 bits. You should export the keys in the PEM format as public.pem and private.pem. We have already done this in Assignment 2.
 - **Balance**: You need to ask the user for an alias or a public key. You'll then make a request to the `/getUnusedOutputs` endpoint to fetch all the unused outputs for this user. Sum up the amounts in all the outputs and this will be the balance for this user. This is pretty straighforward too.
 - **Transfer**: This is the most complex part. You must ask the user for their public and private keys, and fetch this user's unused outputs. Then you must show the user their balance, and ask the number of outputs. Then for each output, you must ask the user if they want to use an alias for the recipient or the public key, and if they specify an alias, you must fetch the public key for this alias from the server. Then you must ask for the amount of coins they want to transfer to this recipient. Once the details of all the outputs have been collected, you must ask for the transaction fee that they want to leave. This is all the data that the user needs to provide. With this data, you calculate the total amount of coins required in the input (sum of txn fees and the amounts of all outputs). If this is greater than their balance, you must show an error. Otherwise, from the unused outputs of this user, you must choose as many inputs as needed such that the sum of these inputs is at least equal to what is required. If this sum exceeds the requirement, you must create another output, giving the remainder of the coins back to the user. With all this data of inputs and outputs, you then make a request to the server.


This entire thing can be implemented as a standalone program (a command line application or a GUI program) or as a web app (like iitkbucks.pclub.in). I leave the choice up to you. If you have never done frontend development before, you might want to choose the standalone application method. 

The command line program is a nice way, and you need no introduction to any new technologies. You can beautify your command line application too, if you want :p.
For a web app, you will need to use Javascript. Further, you'll need to use a framework like React/Angular/Vue, because you need to do some non-trivial cryptography and so you'd need libraries.
For a GUI program, you'll need GUI libraries. For Javascript, I know this can be done using Electron.js (though I've never done it myself). For python, you can use tkinter. Java has the awesome Swing framework.

Please choose the method that you're comfortable working with. Remember that we have less than 5 days, and we also need to do trial runs to find any inconsistencies and bugs. The deadline for this task is July 16, 10:00 AM. I'm hoping that we'll do a test run in the afternoon that day.
