# IITKBucks-meta
This repo contains the messages and notes shared with the students involved in the `IITKBucks` Summer Project under the Programming Club.

The ascending-order naming of files matches the sequence in which the messages were sent. If you want to do the project on your own, you should probably start by looking at the file `001.md`.
