Hi!

This is officially the end of this project. If your node still has some problems and you are unsatisfied with it, you can message me, and I'll help you resolve the problems.

I understand the we rushed through the project in the last 1-2 weeks, and this could have been better planned out. I thank you all for not giving up, and continuing to fix the numerous bugs. 

The server at iitkbucks.pclub.in will keep running for now. If no one messages me with any issues, I'll shut it down, and put up a documentation of the project on that url, which will remain there at least until I graduate. :p 

Also, congratulations, you just built an entire working blockchain mining node all by yourself. For many of you, this would be your first major project. I hope you all learnt something new. I definitely learn a few things - both when building my own node, and when helping you fix problems in your nodes. Yatharth has written down the things that he learnt in the README file of his main repo. I would encourage all of you to do something similar. Ideally this should be done in a blog post, but for those of you who don't blog, putting it in the Readme should be good enough. (I recommend all of you to set up a personal blog, though.)

There are a few things that I wanted to cover but could not, like changing the target value to be dynamically determined instead of being fixed, and chain reorganization when multiple valid blocks have the same index. Nevertheless, what you have built is a functional blockchain system.

Some things were highly simplified - like we used public keys as addresses (usually, a hash of the public key is used as an address, because that's much shorter, and easier to share), and we used a fixed algorithm for keys and signatures (RSA with key size 2048, saltLength 32) (usually, blockchains support multiple algorithms, and instead of a recipient field, they have a 'lock' - where the first 4 bytes determine which type of algorithm to use, and the subsequent bytes contain the other details related to that algorithm, and to 'unlock' the output, you need to provide an 'unlocking script', which is essentially a signature for that algorithm)

If you wish to explore the field of blockchains further, you can read about smart contracts. If you like the field of cyber security, you can read up about attacks on blockchain systems - they are really amazing. At our C3i Center, we have the National Blockchain Project (https://blockchain.cse.iitk.ac.in). If you approach Prof. Sandeep K. Shukla, he can give you a project there.

I also hope that you learnt some good coding practices. When you're building a large project, in the later stages you often face problems that could have been avoided if you had written better code in the beginning. Some of you may look at your code and say that you could rewrite the entire thing in a much better way - maybe with proper code structure, better classes, etc. This only means that you now have a better sense of what is good code, than you had when you began your project. But it is not worth trying to re-write the project, or doing any major changes now. Instead, you can spend that time building something new. And I hope that in your future projects, you will put to use your improved sense of code-quality.

I would like you all to fill a short feedback form. You can fill it anonymously if you wish. https://forms.gle/MEibwWVVB5LiSuYa8

If you have any questions regarding anything, please feel free to ask.
