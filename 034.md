So here's what we will do:

 - Maintain a list of all the unused outputs (a pair of transaction ID and input index) that belong to a public key. This data structure could be a map from the public key to the array/vector of outputs.
 - In the function in which you process a block, update this map.

For ease of use, we'd optionally want people to be able to refer to themselves using an alias. This is pretty simple, we just need to store a map from an alias to a public key. So we make these endpoints:

 - `/addAlias`: It takes an alias and a public key and adds it to the map. This method should return status code 400 is the alias is already set. Note that when a valid request is received, you are supposed to propagate it to the entire network, like with a transaction or a block, by making the same request to your peers. This endpoint accepts a POST request of the following format:
```
{
    alias: <some short string, like a username>,
    publicKey: <the public key>
}
```

 - `/getPublicKey`: It takes an alias and returns its public key, if it exists. Otherwise it returns status code 404. The request is in the following format:
```
{
    alias: <the alias>
}
```

 - `/getUnusedOutputs`: which accepts a POST request containing a public key or the alias, in the following format:
```
{
    publicKey: <the public key>
    alias: <the alias>
}
```
Note that only one field is required. If the alias is specified, then you must retrieve the public key from your alias-publicKey map and then proceed. If your map has a record for this public key, return the list of unused outputs for it, in the following format:
```
{
    unusedOutputs: [
        {
            transactionId: <txn id>,
            index: <index of the output>,
            amount: <number of coins in this output>
        },
        ...
    ]
}
```

Make these endpoints, then the rest of it would be frontend stuff.
