Hey all!

Suppose I am an attacker. I have some coins. I create two transactions that use the same input, but have different outputs. I send one transaction to one particular node, and the second one to another node. How is our system supposed to handle such a case?

One way would be that each node accepts whichever transaction it received first as the valid transaction, and the second transaction as the invalid transaction. However, with this, we'll have different nodes disagreeing over which transaction is valid. We do not want the nodes to disagree with each other. 

Hence, we accept both the transactions. Whichever transaction is mined first becomes the valid transaction, and the other one becomes the invalid transaction. 

So how do we implement this? Currently, we are verifying transactions as soon as we receive them. Then we never try to verify it again. So now we should also perform the verification part when we are trying to include a transaction in our block for mining. This way, if a transaction was found to be valid when we received it, but its input has been spent in another transaction since then, the input of this transaction would have been removed from our list of unused transaction outputs. So now this transaction will fail the verification process. Hence, we will not include this transaction in our block.

This seems good. However, this method works if one of those two transactions is confirmed before the other one. An output is not removed from the list of unused transaction outputs until a block is mined. What if a miner includes both the transactions in the same block? In that case, the transactions would still be considered valid. We need to take care of this scenario too. 

A simple way would be to create a temporary array of outputs. So if we want to include a transaction in our next block, we move its input from the list of unused outputs to a temporary array. If the mining was successful, we just clear the temporary array. If it was unsuccessful, or if we received another valid block in the meantime, we should move all the elements of this temporary array back to the main array.
