We should now start the work on our main application. We'll build it step by step. The first thing that we should implement is a check for the validilty of a transaction. Precisely, you should check for the following:

 - All its inputs exist in our list of unused outputs.
 - All the signatures are correct.
 - It doesn't spend more coins than it is allowed to.
 
Note that a coinbase transaction (the first transaction in every block) does not obey these rules. So for that, you'll need a separate function. We can implement that later. 

To verify a signature, we need the user to sign something that everyone agrees on. So what data should a user sign? It should satisfy the following:
 - The data should be such that the user would never need to sign that same data again (otherwise someone else could use the old signature to claim the someone else's coins).
 - The data should be such that it prevents tampering of the transaction (ie, prevents others from using this signature to create a transaction with the same inputs and different outputs).
 
Since one output can only be spent once, we can use the transaction ID and the index of the input as the data to satisfy the first condition. However, we need to bind the outputs to the signature too, to satisfy the second condition. For this, we can use the SHA256 hash of the total output data. Precisely, we use the SHA256 hash of this part:

`[number of outputs][number of coins in output 1][length of the public key for output 1][the public key for output 1][number of coins in output 2][length of the public key for output 2][the public key for output 2]...`

Thus, our data to be signed looks like this:

`[32 bytes for transaction ID of the input][4 bytes for the index of the input][32 bytes for the sha256 hash of the output data]`

This gives us a byte array of length 68. This is the data that a user needs to sign.

I hope you have already coded up the models needed for this task, in previous assignments.

Please fill this form with the link to the repo of your main application: https://forms.gle/FAxZsuC3TcVkN4Jb7

I have created an issue on my repo: https://github.com/dryairship/IITKBucks/issues/1
React to it appropriately once you have done the task.
