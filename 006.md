Some stats about assignments.

There are 14 of you:

 - 5 of you are using only nodejs. (Category A)
 - 5 of you are using only python. (Category B)
 - 3 of you are using a strange mixture of python and nodejs, which is okay for assignments, but please decide on one language that you'll use for your main application. (Category C)
 - 1 of you is using a horribly strange mixture of c++ and python. I assume that you will finally develop your main application in python. (Category D)

Regarding Assignment 2:

 - All assignments belonging to category A were perfect (or close to perfect).
 - 1 assignments of category C was perfect. The other 2 used PKCS1_15 instead of PSS
 - The assignment of category D used OAEP instead of PSS.
 - For Category B, I did not receive 2 assignments. Out of the 3 I received, one was dumping the keys in binary format instead of PEM format, and the other 2 had very minor problems.
 
Since Assignment 2 is a very important assignment (we'll need to verify signatures A LOT), and not a trivial one (like the nonce assignment), I'll be releasing links to two assignments (one in nodejs, and one in python), which work properly. I would request all of you to go through those submissions once, and compare it with yours, to verify that you are performing essentially the same steps (as we'll need all the clients to agree with each other).
