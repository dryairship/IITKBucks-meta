Hey all!

Here's what we have done so far:
 - We know how to represent transactions and blocks as binary objects.
 - We know how to check if someone is allowed to use an output, by verifying signatures.
 - We know how to calculate transaction IDs.
 - We know how to mine a block by finding a nonce.
 - We know how to create a decentralized network of peers.

Now we'll talk about the lifecycle of a blockchain. Suppose you are a user. You received some coins in an output. Now you want to spend them. Here's what you'll do:
 - Take the transaction ID and the index of the output that you want to use, in the transaction. Transaction ID is of 32 bytes. The index is of 4 bytes. You concat these together to get a 36-byte array.
 - You sign these 36 bytes with your private key to get the signature.
 - If you want to use multiple inputs, then you repeat the first two steps multiple times.
 - Then you create outputs: you take the public keys of the recipients and assign them coins. You also need to leave a few coins for the miner as a transaction fee (more on this later).
 - You send all this data to a node on the network. This node will spread this transaction to all its peers. Eventually, every node on the network will know about your transaction.
 - Wait for the transaction to be included in a block.

Each node maintains a list of unused transaction outputs, and a list of transactions that are yet to be mined.

When a node receives your transaction, here's what it would do:
 - Check if all the inputs exist in its list of unused transaction outputs.
 - Check if all the signatures are valid. 
 - Check if the sum of coins in outputs is less than or equal to the sum of coins in inputs.
 - If everything is valid, it will add the transaction to its list of pending transactions, and share the transaction with its peers. If some check fails, it will discard the transaction and will not forward it to its peers.
 
Whenever a node successfully mines a block, it shares the block with its peers. Whenever a node receives a mined block, here's what it would do:
 - Check if the hash is below the target.
 - Check if the block header is correctly constructed.
 - Check if all the transactions are valid (i.e. all of the steps in the previous paragraph)
 - If everything is valid, it would do the "new-block" steps (described below).

Whenever a node mines a new block, or it verifies that the block it has received is a valid block, it does the following "new-block" steps:
 - Forward the block to its peers.
 - Remove all the transactions that were included in this block from its list of pending transactions.
 - Remove all the inputs that were used in this block from its list of unused transaction outputs.
 - Add all the outputs created in this block to its list of unused transaction outputs.
 - Add the block to its local blockchain (i.e., store it somewhere on the computer)
 - Start mining a new block.

For some reasons (mainly the speed and complexity of mining a block) we need to put a limit on the size of a block. 1 MB (10^6 bytes) is a good enough limit. This is just a max limit, and much smaller blocks can exist too.

So here is how a node starts mining a new block:
 - Take some transactions from its list of pending transactions (usually, a miner would take them in the decreasing order of transaction fees - to earn more) such that the total size does not exceed (10^6 - 116) bytes.
 - Try to find a nonce that works.
 - If while mining, you receive a block, and have verified it to be correct, then do the "new-block" steps and restart mining.
 - If you find a valid nonce, do the "new-block" steps and restart mining.
 
I think I have covered the entire lifecycle. There is no assignment for now. Just understand the lifecycle. If you have any doubts or if you find any interesting loopholes in this lifecycle, please ask here.
