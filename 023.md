Hey all!

Suppose our nodes are all ready and the cryptocurrency is live, and we're all trying to mine a block. Then suppose someone mines a block, and immediately (a fraction of a second later) another node mines a block with the same index. Let us call the blocks `Block1` and `Block2` The two blocks will have the same parent, and some common transactions. Both of these will be valid blocks. Also, both the nodes will share their own block to their peers. So some peers will receive `Block1` first, while some will receive `Block2` first. So what should happen when the nodes receive the second block?

One solution is that the nodes store the later received block(s) with the same index somewhere for future reference, but assume the first received block as the correct block. For example, suppose your node receives `Block` first, and then `Block2`. So it will continue mining new transactions using the `Block1` as the parent block. In the meantime, if it receives a newly mined block from a peer, it'll check the hash of the parent. If this is the same as the hash of the `Block1`, then everything is good and it will just continue working normally. 

If, however, the parent hash is different, it'll compare the hash with that of the other block(s) that it received with that index (i.e., `Block2`). So suppose that the parent hash of the newly mined block matches the hash of `Block2`. Then your node will undo the changes of `Block1`, and do the changes that are in `Block2`, and the newly mined block.

Undoing the changes of a block means:
 - All the transactions in this block are added back to the pending transactions list.
 - All the outputs that were created in this block are deleted from the unused outputs list.
 - All the inputs that were used in this block are added back to the unused outputs list.

When you undo a change of a block, and do the changes of a new block in its place, this is called `chain reorganization`. Note that chain reorganization is not limited to just the last block, it may happen with a block 3-4 levels deep in the blockchain. In that case, you'll undo the changes of the blocks in reverse order (decreasing order of indices), and then do the changes of the correct blocks in the normal order.

Any questions?
