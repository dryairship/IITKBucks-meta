Hey all!

There are a few issues related to the timestamp.

A lot of you have used the timestamp in the wrong format (i.e., either it's not nano-time, or the time is wrong, or it is not properly converted to binary...)

Javascript has a nice external library (`nano-time`) which gives us a string with nanosecond precision. You can convert this to a BigInt, and you have exactly what you need. This BigInt must be converted to exactly 4 bytes when storing in the block header.

Java 8 has a built in library `java.time` which can provide Unix time in a complex way - and you'd need to do some math to get it in the Unix nano format.

Python's `time.time()` function returns a floating point value with microsecond precision. You can multiply this with 10^9, but the last 3 digits will always be 000. Rather, if you are using python3.7+ (and I hope you aren't using any version older than this), you can (and should) do `time.time_ns()`.

Note: you don't have to update your assignments (you can, if you want to). Just keep this in mind when you are building the main application.
