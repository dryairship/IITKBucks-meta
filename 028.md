Hey all!

Remember that you add peers by sending a request to them? Now suppose there is a very popular peer such that everyone is connected to it. The it will spend a major part of it's resources in sending all the transactions and blocks to so many peers. For this, it would like to place a limit on the number of peers it can have. Normally, this can be between 10-100. For our purpose, you can set this to be around 3-5. 

So what happens when you send a `/newPeer` request to someone who has filled their peer limit? They will return HTTP Server Error (Response Code: `500`). So whenever you send an /newPeer request, check for the response code. It if is not `200`, then they did not add you as a peer. So you must not add them as your peer. Instead, you should ask them for their list of peers, and add the nodes in this list to your `potential peers`. Then you should send a `/newPeer` request to all your potential peers, and repeat this process until you achieve your peer limit or until your potential peers list is empty.

So now you need to do this modification in your `/newPeer` method.
