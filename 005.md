Hey all! Pause your work on the main application (or maybe continue it in the background). Don't worry if you haven't made much (or any) progress. I promise you that things would start making sense soon (if they don't already).

If you look at our previous model, there is one strong flaw in it. Any user can point to any unused transaction output, and claim that it belongs to him (since you aren't verifying the user in the transaction's input part).

We'll address it today. We'll make use of some cryptography to do so.

There are various types of cryptographic algorithms. Some are reversible (like base64) and some are irreversible (like SHA256) (irreversible means that you cannot find out the original data from the encrypted data).

Some reversible cryptographic functions do not use any keys (like base64), but some do.

Among those reversible cryptographic methods that use keys, we have two classes: Symmetric encryption and Asymmetric encryption.
In symmetric encryption, the same key is used to encrypt and decrypt data.
In asymmetric encryption, there are two keys: a public key and a private key. Something encrypted using the public key can only be decrypted using the private key (and vice versa).

Suppose we generate a public-private key pair for each user. The private key of a user is a secret (and is known only to them), while their public key is publicly available. 

When we have to send coins to someone, we put their public key in the recipient field.

So suppose there is a particular transaction, in which there is an output which sends coins to me. How do I claim that those coins belong to me? 

The aim is to prove that the public key belongs to you. If the public key belongs to you, the coins belong to you.

A simple way would be to declare your private key. Then anyone could encrypt some text with the public key, and try to decrypt it using the private key given by you. If the decryption is successful, it means that the coins belong to you. However, your private key is your only identity, and sharing your private key with anyone allows them to misuse it (for example, claim and use coins that belong to you). As a rule: never share your private keys with anyone.

So we can't share private keys. How do we claim the coins now? We use signatures!

Suppose you generate a random text, and encrypt it using your private key. Then you declare both the original text, and the encrypted text. Then anyone with your public key (which is available there in the output) can try to decrypt the encrypted text. If the decryption is successful, and the decrypted text equals the original text given by you, it means that the public key is yours. This is how signatures work.

If you have any doubts regarding this, please ask.

So now you have your second assignment. Write a program that asks the user for 3 inputs: 
1. The public key of the user
2. The unencrypted text
3. The encrypted text
The encryption method used will be RSA. There are two popular padding methods: OAEP and PKCS. We will use the OAEP padding (You don't have to understand the differences. Just know that if something is using PKCS, it is old and can be "hacked".). You have to verify if the public key can decrypt the encrypted text, and that the decrypted text is equal to the unencrypted text provided by the user. Print "Signature verified!" if the verification is successful, otherwise print "Verification failed".

Note: Keys are generally shared using a .pub/.pem file. So when you ask the public key of the user, they will provide you a path to a file. You should read the signature from that file. Most languages have libraries to load signatures directly from files.

The format in which the encrypted text is provided will depend on the language and the libraries used. (We need to work on how to make this uniform.)

So for now, in your README file for this assignment, give sample inputs (one that is correct, and one that fails). Your repository should also contain two files for a randomly generated key pair (public.pub and private.pem) and a program that takes some input text, and a private key file, and encrypts the text using that private key.

**Note :**  
A senior sent me this: https://crypto.stackexchange.com/questions/29354/why-not-use-oaep-for-signatures  
So we shouldn't use OAEP for signatures. We should use PSS, because that's designed specifically for signatures.  
I apologize for the confusion. I didn't know about it this.

## Questions

### If I encrypt some message with my private key and declare it, then anyone with my public key can decrypt that right? since my public key is actually public, any user can claim it then. so how does this method ensure that only a particular user is able to claim it?

If the signature comes from you, it means you have the private key. Basically, you just have to tell the cryptocurrency software that you can use that particular output which was sent to you. So when you want to use it as an input, if you send, lets say, a signature that encrypts the transaction ID (and the output ID), the software will believe that whoever wants to use the output is the only person who is allowed to use that output.

### When I try to decrypt the cipherText using a public key, python is throwing an error `TypeError: This is not a private key`, but when I tried the other way round(encrypting with public and decrypting with private) it executed as expected. Is there any workaround?

Usually, libraries allow encryption only using the public key, and decryption only using the private key. The reverse is possible theoretically, but the implementation is different, and it is available by other names (like sign (to encrypt using a private key) and verify (to decrypt using a public key))

### Is anyone facing "Passphrase required for encrypted key" issue while trying crypto.sign() in Nodejs? I saved the keys in a .pem file and used fs module to read the key from the file.

**Self Answer :** Ok got it. While generating the key pair, we need to skip the 'passphrase' as well as the 'cipher' argument
