The first block in a blockchain has no parent block. This is one major exception (just like the first transaction in every block). Various blockchains have their own versions of how this block is used. For our purpose, we'll define it like this:
 - It will have 1 transaction - the first transaction that contains the block reward, given to me :p.
 - The target value will be `0000000f00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000`.
 - The parent hash will be `0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000`.

Then mining this block will give me some block reward. I will use this block reward to create transactions. All of us will then try to mine these transactions, and create further blocks.

While verifying this block, it must be remembered that this block is an exception with regard to the parent hash. One easy way to do this would be to make a function that returns the hash of the block at a particular index (and call this function when you're trying to match the parent hash), and if the index is `-1` (which is what you'd arrive at if you do `index-1` for this block), this function returns `0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000`. Alternatively, you could have this check in the verification function itself.

Here's how we process a block:
 - Remove all the transactions that were included in this block from the list of pending transactions.
 - Remove all the inputs that were used in this block from the list of unused transaction outputs.
 - Add all the outputs created in this block to the list of unused transaction outputs.
 - Add the block to your local blockchain (i.e., store it somewhere on the computer).

So now you should write a function that is executed when you start your application. You should first try to find peers. If you don't find a peer, you cannot continue. So the program should end if you don't get a peer.
Once you have at least one peer, you should request it for the blocks (start with 0, end when you get a 404 response). You should then process each block (without verification, for now), thereby generating your list of unused outputs. When you're finished with this, you should ask for the list of pending transactions.

Doing this will set your node up for mining (you don't have to code that part right now).

So here are the tasks that you have to do:
 - Modify the /newPeer function
 - Create a function to find peers
 - Create a function to process blocks
 - Create a function to perform the initialization steps (i.e, finding peers, asking for blocks and transactions, and processing blocks)
