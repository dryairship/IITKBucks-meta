With this, you have your assignments 3 and 4. Note that you'll be using a major part of your code for both these assignments in your main application. Therefore, follow good coding styles. Also, I advise you to distribute your code into functions, so that you can directly copy-paste the functions into your main application, when required. A great way to do this is to have all your IO stuff in one function (i.e., the main function) only, and then the IO function collects the data from the user and calls some other function which works on the data (which also calls other helper functions for sub tasks) and returns the output to the calling function, which then prints/saves the output.

For assignment 3, you have to write a program that asks for transaction data and creates a binary file (i.e., not 1s and 0s in text format, but actual binary data) for that transaction. So you first ask for the number of inputs (to be entered as an integer), and for each input, you ask for a transaction ID (to be entered in hex format), the index (to be entered as an integer), and a signature (to be entered in hex format). Then you ask for the number of outputs (to be entered as an integer), and for each output, you ask the number of coins (to be entered as a 64-bit integer) and the path of a public key (.pem) file. Then you create the transaction data in binary format, as described above, and calculate its hash (the transaction ID). Then you save this binary data into a file named `<the calculated transaction ID in hex format>.dat` (without the <>, of course). You don't have to verify anything in the transaction data. Just accept whatever the user gives you.

The deadline for assignment 3 is 11:59 AM IST on May 14, 2020. 

For assignment 4, you just have to do the reverse, i.e., you have to write a program that asks for a file path, reads that file for transaction data, calculates the transaction ID, and print all the details for that transaction. The file will contain binary data for one transaction. You have to print the output in the following format:

```
Transaction ID: <in hex format>

Number of inputs: <an integer>

    Input 1:
        Transaction ID: <in hex format>
        Index: <an integer>
        Length of the signature: <an integer>
        Signature: <in hex format>

    Input 2:
        Transaction ID: <in hex format>
        Index: <an integer>
        Length of the signature: <an integer>
        Signature: <in hex format>

    ...

Number of outputs: <an integer>

    Output 1:
        Number of coins: <an integer>
        Length of public key: <an integer>
        Public key: <in PEM format>

    Output 2:
        Number of coins: <an integer>
        Length of public key: <an integer>
        Public key: <in PEM format>

    ...
```

The deadline for assignment 4 is 11:59 PM IST on May 15, 2020.
