As the project was getting boring (with all those stupid programming assignments), I think we should now start with an actual server (so you'd appreciate the coolness of distributed systems).

I assume all of you know how to make a web server.

I also hope you know what a map (the data structure) is.

So here you have your assignment 6. You application should maintain a map (where the keys are integers, and values are strings). You have to create a web server that has two endpoints:

`/add` : This endpoint will accept POST requests containing JSON encoded data in the following format:
```
{
    'key': <an integer>,
    'value': <a string>
}
```
When your server receives a POST request on this endpoint, it should add the key:value pair in your map. If the key is already set, you should do nothing, and ignore this request.

`/list` : When this endpoint receives a GET request, it should return all the entries in your map as json data in the following format:
```
{
    key1: value1,
    key2: value2,
    key3: value3,
    ...
}
```

You also need to maintain a list of 2/3 "peers". For now, this can be hardcoded as an array in your program. Whenever you add a new key to your map, you should send POST requests to all your peers (so that they may add this value too).


Also, all of you should either download (https://ngrok.com/download), or install the `ngrok` package. You DON'T need to register an account to use it.

The deadline for this assignment is 11:59 AM IST, May 28, 2020. 

I wish that we all be online at some time in the evening on May 28, or some time on May 29, so that we may observe all the servers in action (Hint: It will be fun!). Is 4PM on May 28 fine with everyone? If not, react with a banana (:banana:) on this message.
