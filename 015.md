Hey all!

Congratulations! Now you all can correctly calculate the ID of a transaction from the transaction data, and can also understand transaction data sent to you from another client. Now we move on to the representation of a block.

A block has two parts: The block body and the block header.

The body of a block is just the transaction data combined together. It looks like this:

```
[number of transactions in this block][size of transaction 1][data of transaction 1][size of transaction 2][data of transaction 2]...
```

This is similar to how you combine inputs or outputs in a transaction. Precisely, given a blob of data representing the body of a block, you interpret it as follows:

 - You read the first 4 bytes. This represents an integer. This is the number of transactions in this block. Let this value be `n`.
 - You do the following steps `n` times:
   - Read the next 4 bytes. This represents an integer. This is the size (in bytes) of this transaction. Let this value be `x`.
   - Read the next `x` bytes. This is the entire transaction data. This is exactly the data that you calculated in assignment 3.


Now let us talk about the block header. The block header contains important information about the block. Recall that a block is mined by finding a nonce value such that the hash calculated is below the target. So we obviously need to store the nonce value in the header.

You would have seen that the data for a single transaction can be very large. And it would be so much more bigger for an entire block, which contains so many transactions. Calculating the nonce can become a very slow process if we keep calculating the hash of the entire block body for every nonce value that we try. For this reason, we only use the block header to calculate nonce values. However, we need to include something related to the transactions in our nonce calculation. So we store a short summary of all the transactions in the block header. Usually, this is done in a more sophisticated manner, but for now, we'll just use the SHA-256 hash of the block body as the summary of transactions. Also, from now on, the hash of a block will mean the hash of the block header. I'll use the term "block body" whenever I need to refer to the hash of the block body.

Also, recall that each block needs to have some data regarding the parent block. For this, we store the hash of the parent block in the current block's header.

Also, for reasons that will make sense later, we also need to store the target value that was used for calculating the nonce for this block.

So we have the following fields: the index of the block, the SHA-256 hash of the block body, the hash of the parent block, the target value, and the nonce.

Nonce, here, is the smallest non-negative number that makes the hash of the block smaller than the target. Now suppose that we only use these fields in the block header. If you notice carefully, you'll realize that if we fix the first 4 values, the 5th value will automatically get fixed. So mining will become a race for finding this fixed value. Now suppose one of you has a computer which is just slightly faster than everyone else's computer. If all of you start mining at the same time, the fastest computer will always win the race. However, this is against the spirit of a distributed system. So we need some randomness so that the fastest computer doesn't always win the race. Of course, there will always be multiple values, that, when used as nonce, will bring the hash of the block below the target. So you can try hunting for a nonce randomly, instead of trying to find the smallest non-negative value. Very well, this is good enough. However, it becomes slightly complex to implement (eg. you need to find a unique random number every time, as repeated values won't help). We can improve the model further. Let us store the timestamp of the moment we try to calculate the block hash using a particular nonce value. This timestamp will be different for every nonce value that is tried. So the hash of the block will depend on two values - the nonce value that is tried, and the timestamp of the instant that particular nonce value is tried. So we don't need to find the correct nonce value, but the correct combination of the nonce value and the timestamp. This introduces sufficient psuedo-randomness into the model, and we can go back to finding nonce values starting with 0, instead of trying them out randomly. Note that the fastest computer will still have an edge over others (as it can try more values in a fixed time). However, it will not be the winner every time. The timestamp that we'll use will be the Unix time in nanoseconds.

This gives us six fields: index of the block, hash of the parent block, hash of the block body, target value, timestamp, nonce. Each field here has a fixed size. So a block header has a fixed size. So this is how the block header is represented:

 - The first 4 bytes represent an integer. This is the index of the block.
 - The next 32 bytes represent the SHA256 hash of the parent block.
 - The next 32 bytes represent the SHA256 hash of the block body.
 - The next 32 bytes represent the target value.
 - The next 8 bytes represent a 64-bit integer. This is the timestamp.
 - The next 8 bytes represent a 64-bit integer. This is the nonce value.

Thus, the block header will always be of size 116 bytes. The block header, followed by the block body, constitutes an entire block.

All integers are unsigned, and are stored in the big-endian format.
