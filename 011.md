Hey all!

About 80% of you had to do some minor changes in your submissions for assignment 4 to make it compliant with everyone else. However, 80% of that 80% forgot to do the corresponding changes in the submissions for assignment 3. So here I am attaching a sample interation with your program for assignment 3:

```

Enter txn ID for input 2: 92a7c6d00b98e7824efe0a61bed2c9c7bbe7d787a15ff7dd8117bded3b74654d    
Enter index of output for input 2: 123
Enter signature for input 2: 815f8a1c176d216a804f62be7ced9f82df1e82d5953d9b0757d71d6d7495a5305753c0f7353bd8754a9980446aac55eeef82a1ddd3791aac112a2be47f57c49b6799f5a624d97445dc6a416d2ccfd713564277ae69b9ba62d659c0e037296c0c1fa674b9a53c827a5857f7c982d2a41d9a6df16d6e2c39c8207381cb14c08204a1b18c7d17d3fe6e63e45fb3131821430942b51117476636a0ff1a3586e493efb44f8399a9d1e76d9c016278b492bd9d33e849a51c6139c99b16a6c91cfe1aac1567b6a26fe6fec7a5a11d0b218b4072f51a5c4b06d515580a1a8df99a65d7a35e2941393c400ac59dcb8f5f4d1e8c280cbc6a0917be8e9c58a43196ca495505
Enter number of outputs: 2
Enter number of coins for output 1: 887766
Enter the location of public key file for output 1: 012.pem
Enter number of coins for output 2: 11223344
Enter the location of public key file for output 2: 013.pem 
```

The files `012.pem` and `013.pem` are attached.

This interaction should produce a file `4363de44cf11799a8b2ae12074fc8edf82aa0ec698c5591498a5f286f59cf0f4.dat`. (You just need to match the file name, as it is the hash of the data inside the file.)

Reach with :+1: on this message if the name of the file produced by your program matches with the given file name.

If you are getting a different file name, and wish to compare your file with the the expected file, you can do so using the hexdump command.

```
hexdump -C 4363de44cf11799a8b2ae12074fc8edf82aa0ec698c5591498a5f286f59cf0f4.dat
```

The above command will print the hexdump of the file in a pretty format, so that you can easily compare where your file differs from the expected file. The expected file is attached with the name `014.dat`.
